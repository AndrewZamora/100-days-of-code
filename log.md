# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 15, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
Finished making a Vanilla JavaScript accordion. Solved one algorithm on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** 
Still learning how to use the spread operator. However, it was useful in converting a string into an array.

### Day 2: September 16, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
Solved Sorted Union algorithm on freeCodeCamp. Learned how add default parameters to a function in JavaScript. Here are some  resources on Default Parameters on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/894860/set-a-default-parameter-value-for-a-javascript-function) .
I also got a chance to make a loading widget out of CSS. 

**Thoughts:** 
Being able to create default parameters is really nice but I'm not sure what to do if you receive more parameters than you expect.

In terms of CSS animations, I think the concept of @keyframes are great because you can write one animation and use it several times. The difficult part is getting several animated elements in sync with each other.

### Day 3: September 17, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
I got tripped up with Unicode characters on freeCodeCamp's Convert HTML Entities algorithm but managed to finish it. I also made a basic Vanilla JavaScript Carousel.

**Thoughts:** 
The Carousel wasn't too bad but I want to add better transitions and I also want add hand swiping to it.

### Day 4: September 18, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
Finished freeCodeCamp's Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers Algorithm. Started working on a floating action button. I was hoping to finish it today but wasn't able to. I should have a demo up tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** 
I used the reduce method to get the sum of an array. I haven't used it very much. So I will have to look into it more later.

### Day 5: September 19, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
I didn't finish an algorithm on freeCodeCamp today. But, I finished the Vanilla JavaScript action button I was working on yesterday. I think the transition came out ok. 

**Thoughts:** 
I'm slowly getting hang of transitions. I might need to alternate between doing algorithms and making small components.

### Day 6: September 20, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
I solved Sum All Primes algorithm on freeCodeCamp today. 

**Thoughts:** 
I need to stop nesting loops and start breaking code up into functions that can be used in a loop or higher order function.

### Day 7: September 21, 2018


**Today's Progress**:
 Moved one of my vanilla JS components into my React project.

**Thoughts:**
Felt like a lot of work just to get the scroll height of a child element from a ref. I wonder is there is a better way?

### Day 8: September 22, 2018


**Today's Progress**:
Continued working on my React app. Still looking for a way to get around refs for scroll height. I also changed things up and went to a Meetup in Osaka. The view at the location was crazy.

**Thoughts:**
Think meet ups are a good way to take a break and see what others are doing.

### Day 9: September 23, 2018


**Today's Progress**:
Thanks to a friend and Twitter I was inspired to try CSS animations with scroll. Not quite what I wanted but I think it came out OK.

**Thoughts:**
It's nice to pick a small project that can be done in an hour. It makes you feel very accomplished.

### Day 10: September 24, 2018


**Today's Progress**:
I got all the tests to pass locally for freeCodeCamp's Smallest Common Multiple Algorithm but the last test won't pass on their website so I'm doing something wrong but can't see it. I'll try again later and hopefully my mistake will be clear to me.

**Thoughts:**
When my code just won't work, I think I just need to go for a walk.

### Day 11: September 25, 2018


**Today's Progress**:
Started building a login/Sign up page with React.js , React Router, and MaterializeCSS.

**Thoughts:**
I like the idea of building components that can be reused.
