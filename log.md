# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 15, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
Finished making a Vanilla JavaScript accordion. Solved one algorithm on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** 
Still learning how to use the spread operator. However, it was useful in converting a string into an array.

### Day 2: September 16, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
Solved Sorted Union algorithm on freeCodeCamp. Learned how add default parameters to a function in JavaScript. Here are some  resources on Default Parameters on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/894860/set-a-default-parameter-value-for-a-javascript-function) .
I also got a chance to make a loading widget out of CSS. 

**Thoughts:** 
Being able to create default parameters is really nice but I'm not sure what to do if you receive more parameters than you expect.

In terms of CSS animations, I think the concept of @keyframes are great because you can write one animation and use it several times. The difficult part is getting several animated elements in sync with each other.

### Day 3: September 17, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
I got tripped up with Unicode characters on freeCodeCamp's Convert HTML Entities algorithm but managed to finish it. I also made a basic Vanilla JavaScript Carousel.

**Thoughts:** 
The Carousel wasn't too bad but I want to add better transitions and I also want add hand swiping to it.

### Day 4: September 18, 2018


**Today's Progress**: 
Finished freeCodeCamp's Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers Algorithm. Started working on a floating action button. I was hoping to finish it today but wasn't able to. I should have a demo up tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** 
I used the reduce method to get the sum of an array. I haven't used it very much. So I will have to look into it more later.
